# Deep-Learning-Exercise-1

Description
In this assignment you will build a deep classification network, optimised for the dataset
[CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) . Your
solution must be a simple feedforward network. Any work you may choose to do with CNNs is
extra and will not itself earn you extra marks â€“ however it will lead to better accuracy.
In optimising your network, make sure you address the following aspects:
1. Data pre-processing
2. Depth and width of your network
3. Choice of activation and loss functions
4. Regularisation
5. Choice of learning optimisers
6. Hyper-parameters, such as batch size, epochs, learning rate, etc., depending on the chosen
configuration.
